# SpinSpinSpin

A Simple MATLAB Simulation for Unstable Free Rotation of a Rigid Body.

NOTE(s):
- Rotating object kinematics is "rotation vector" based.
- Rotation Vector Definition:
  - A rotation vector is a one dimensional row or column vector of length three.
  - The norm of the rotation vector is the rotation angle.
  - The normalized rotation vector is a 3D unit vector which serves as the rotation axis.
- Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are solved using the  Matlab "ode45" function to apply the Dorman-Prince 4(5) explicit embedded adaptive time step Runge-Kutta method.
- State Vector Components:
  - State Vector components 1, 2 and 3 are the "rotation vector".
  - State Vector components 4, 5 and 6 are the angular velocity vector.
- Time rate of change of the rotation vector:
  - The time rate of change of the rotation vector is not the angular velocity vector.
  - To determine the time rate of change of the rotation  vector, use Equation (42) on Page 265 of Reference [ 1 ].
- Note that the 2D plots of inertial angular momentum quantities reveal the constant nature of the inertial angular momentum over time as expected for free rotation.
- Note that the 2D plot of rotational kinetic energy reveals the constant nature of this energy over time as expected for free rotation.
- Note that the 3D animation video reveals the constant nature of the angular momentum vector over time as expected for free rotation.
